<h1>Dogestram</h1>
<p>Dogestam is project of PeNgVu in last year. There was Centos server with Glassfish and MariaDB. It was for dog pictures.
There were lots of problems and some of the planned features were not implemented in its final form.<br><br>
We didn't get the cookies work. That leads to the problem, that server didn't know if someone was logged in or not</p>
